## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Since this project modifies system settings:

- **Never include malicious code** or backdoors
- **Avoid unnecessary system access** - only modify what's needed
- **Document security implications** of any changes
- **Report security issues privately** to maintainers first

## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11 for testing
- Text editor with batch file syntax highlighting
- Git for version control
- Virtual machines recommended for testing

### Testing

- **Test on clean Windows installations** when possible
- **Use virtual machines** for safer testing
- **Create system restore points** before testing
- **Document any issues** encountered during testing

### Style Guidelines

- Use LF endings for docs and scripts; CRLF for Windows-only scripts
- Follow `.editorconfig` conventions
- Keep changes small and focused
- Prefer scripts that are idempotent and well-commented
- Document every change and its rollback

## üìû Getting Help

If you need help with contributing:

1. **Check existing issues** and documentation first
2. **Create a discussion** in the GitHub Discussions tab
3. **Be specific** about what you need help with
4. **Be patient** - maintainers are volunteers

## üèÜ Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- The project's README.md file
- Release notes for significant contributions
