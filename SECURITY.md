# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We aim to keep the default branch secure. Tagged releases may receive fixes as capacity allows.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security reports.

- If hosted on GitHub, create a private Security Advisory (if available)
- Alternatively, contact the maintainers via the repository owner profile
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and impact

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and coordinate a fix and disclosure.
