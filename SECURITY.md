## 🛡️ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Nexus Tweaks project takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email** the maintainers privately at: [security@nexus-tweaks.example.com] *(Update with actual email)*
2. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
3. **Provide** steps to reproduce if possible
4. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Impact** assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Affected versions** of Nexus Tweaks
- **Suggested fix** if you have one

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### System Modifications

Nexus Tweaks modifies Windows system settings, which inherently carries security implications:

- **Administrator privileges** are required for all operations
- **System restore points** are created before making changes
- **All changes** are designed to be reversible
- **No external downloads** or network connections are made

### Code Review

All code changes undergo review for:

- **Malicious code** detection
- **Unnecessary privilege escalation**
- **Unintended system modifications**
- **Proper error handling**

### Safe Usage Guidelines

To use Nexus Tweaks safely:

1. **Review the script** before running it
2. **Create backups** of important data
3. **Use system restore points** before making changes
4. **Test in a VM** if possible
5. **Understand** what each tweak does

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### Potential Risks

While Nexus Tweaks is designed to be safe, system modifications always carry risks:

- **System instability** if changes conflict with hardware/software
- **Reduced security** if privacy tweaks disable legitimate security features
- **Application compatibility** issues with some software
- **Update problems** if Windows Update settings are modified

### Mitigation Strategies

We mitigate these risks by:

- **Extensive testing** on multiple Windows configurations
- **Conservative approach** to system modifications
- **Clear documentation** of all changes made
- **Reversibility** of all tweaks
- **User warnings** about potential impacts
